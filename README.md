Overview of the school district analysis

The school board identified evidence of academic dishonesty with the reading and math grades for 9th grade at Thomas High School.
They appear to have been altered. The school district would like to know the extent to which the suspected academic dishonesty
has affected the grade data by replacing the data for 9th grade at Thomas High School with NaNs.

Results

- How is the district summary affected?
	The data suspected of being altered is only one grade level at one school. The data as a whole is virtually identical
	with or without including 9th grade Thomas High School data. The difference is less than half of one percent.

- How is the school summary affected?
	Since the only data being excluded is for 9th grade Thomas High School data, Thomas High School is the only school affected. 
	Even then, the results are virtually the same.

- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
	After excluding the data, the ranking remains the same.

- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

Math and reading scores by grade
	Minimally, see image
Scores by school spending
        Barely at all.
Scores by school size
        Barely at all.
Scores by school type
        Barely at all.

- Summary

	If there was an attempt at academic dishonesty in trying to change figures, it was not successful. So much so, it raises doubts
	as to weather any inaccuracy was intentional. The scores for Thomas High School are not anomalous, I would ask the school distric
	what it was they found odd about the data.
